When we deployed this app quickly, we did a build spec inline in a CodeBuild job.


I think this is the CodeDeploy one...

version: 0.2
phases:
  install:
    commands:
      - pip install -r requirements.txt #install code dependencies
  build:
    commands:
      - python tests_app.py -v #this will test the app works
artifacts:
  files:
    - '**/*'
